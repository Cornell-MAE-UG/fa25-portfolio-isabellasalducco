## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/Picture.jpeg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }} and I am a sophomore at Cornell University pursuing a degree in Biomedical Engineering with a concentration in Biomechanics and Mechanobiology. I have strong interests in anatomical mechanics research, as well as in the development of innovative biotechnologies. I am particularly passionate about exploring how mechanical forces influence biological systems and how these insights can be applied to create novel medical devices and therapies.
