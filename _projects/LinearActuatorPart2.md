The Problem/Objective:

The second part of the design entailed accounting for the deflection that would occur in a non-rigid beam, that would face some bending moment. 


Constraints:

The assignment parameters required the incorporation of three pin supports (two of which had to be grounded) as well as the use of a linear actuator. Additionally the material and cross section had to selected so that the deflection was no more than 2% of the intial length.


Solution:

To do this I chose an aluminum round bar of diameter 71 mm. In this case the maximum load (30.8 kN) only causes a deflection of 0.000556mm.
