The Problem/Objective:

For this project, I was tasked with developing a system within a 150 cm x 50 cm design space, using a linear actuator to lift the maximum possible load to the greatest height. 


Constraints:

The assignment parameters required the incorporation of three pin supports (two of which had to be grounded) as well as the use of a linear actuator.


Solution:

In my design, I used a 150 cm long bar with a pin support located at the leftmost end. A second pin support was positioned 129.3 cm from the left end, anchoring the linear actuator to the ground. The actuator used was an IMA55 model, capable of extending vertically to a maximum length of 45.72 cm to raise the bar and achieve maximum lift height.

This design is considered optimal because the bar only needs to be elevated 19.47 degrees to lift the load to maximum height. This small angle limits the vertical pushback force on the actuator lessening the importance of a breaking system.
